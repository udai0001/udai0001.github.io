I created this portfolio in the UX design class keeping in mind how I want to be perceived by others when they view my work/website. I always had a thing for websites that were simple, minimalistic, a little fresh and funky and easy to look at. I could've easily gone with something extra and very bold with multiple colors, but I stuck with a simple design/layout with muted/pastel colors to give my portfolio the center of attention.

Coding the website was not that difficult because of Bootstrap. Bootstrap made building grids so much eaiser than CSS. Although it takes quite some time getting used to Bootstrap, it is indeed a very simple and powerful tool when one gets the hang of using it. Also, because my layout was quite simple, forming it with the help of Bootstrap was a life saver.

There were a few challenges/problems I faced while I was coding the website -  

1. One of them was while creating the gallery in the homepage. I tried to find a way to make the images align with eachother but there was always some space left out. Later, I tried searching online for examples of galleries made with bootstrap and I found a solution that took care of that problem.

2. Another problem I faced was with the social media icons (svg). I had downloaded the icons and  inserted them in my html with the img tag. But changing their color wasn't working out. So, I tried different things, and the last thing that worked was when I embeded the icons from the website itself. That helped me in changing the svg's colors.

3. Making the embeded videos responsive and grow in size in my work page wasn't happening when I tried doing that with Bootstrap (maybe I was not referrign tot he right version), but later I watched a tutorial and saw someone wrap the videos in a container and then make it responsive. That worked out for me finally, but I had to do that in CSS.

4. I had to refresh my memory regarding animations when I thought about adding a fade-in effect to my banner and other images on different pages. So I went back tot he course materials, looked at a few articles and got my head around it again.

5. A similar thing about refreshing memory was done with Bootstrap where I had to refer about a few components and utilities once again.

Overall, I learned all the essentials again while I was making my web portfolio. I kept a few things in mind that I have learnt in the past few weeks regarding structure and how to code efficiently. Safe to say, it all helped me in making this website in a shorter duration with a clean layout.

Lastly, all the images and content on the website are my own and nothing was borrowed from any sources.
