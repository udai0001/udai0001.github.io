         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I am a writer and traditional artist. I enjoy writing <em>comedy scripts</em> and drawing <em>intricate manadalas</em></p>
         <p>
             I like to draw inspiration for my art from real life. I love storytelling and drawing influences for my characters from other people's stories.
