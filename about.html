                  <p class="lh-lg">Art is something that lives within all of us, it's just that everyone has different mediums or ways of expressing themselves through art. It's a language on its own and does a great job when it comes to defining who you are as a person, individual, or a professional.</p>

                  <p class="lh-lg">Art requires utmost concentration, but also requires one to be nonchalant. It's this duality of art that got me into designing and illustration. To be creative in several ways, to achieve a sense of satisfaction when someone else appreciates your skill, and when someone trusts you enough to define who they are as a brand/company is why designing is my passion.</p>

                  <h2 class="display-4 fw-bold text-uppercase">Background</h2>
                  <p class="lh-lg">I am from India as you must've already guessed, and I always used to carry a sketch book with me to school...back when I was eight years old. I would draw birds, trees, houses, the sun, clouds, people (stick people) and everything I could possibly see and recreate. Later, when my creative hunger intensified, I started writing songs and poetry. After writing quite a few songs, poems and short stories, I drifted back to drawing, and this time I got into Mandalas. Since then, I haven't turned back and have ventured into digital design. I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, Literature & Journalism from Loyola Academy, Hyderabad. After the completion of my triple major, I had this drive to become independent and live on my own, but there was one problem...I didn't want to do it in my home country. </p>
                  <p class="lh-lg">Hence, I flew all the way to Canada and studied Scriptwriting for a year, from Algonquin College. I wrote a movie, created an original TV show and also made some amazing friends along the way. Writing has always been my forte, but I wanted to expand my horizons even further. So, I applied for the Interactive Media Design course at Algonquin, and voila! Here I am!</p>

          <h2 class="display-3 fw-bold text-uppercase px-5">Current</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg px-5">Currently I am halfway through the IMD course at Algonquin and have learnt A LOT of stuff about UX designing, web development, photography, videography, graphic designing, CMS and what not. I got the opportunity to work on some great projects and get amazing feedback from the professors and peers alike. I love creating websites, prototypes, branding guides, creative briefs and everything involved in developing a brand for anyone who wants to establish themselves and stay true to what they are. I am aiming for nothing but the sky...if the sky is not the limit.</p>

                  <h2 class="display-3 fw-bold text-uppercase">Future</h2>
                  <p class="lh-lg">In the future I plan on world domination! And if you think I am serious then you are absolutely wrong. All I want to do is help people and entrepreneurs out there in setting up a better brand for themselves. I look forward to working with companies who value creative expression, teamwork and customer satisfaction as much as I do. In that case, It wouldn't hurt if I could get into Google, Netflix or Shopify,  but that would require years of experience, and I am ready for that.</p>
